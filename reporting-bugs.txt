Reporting bugs

Basically don't!

This is a developer tool not an end users tool

As a developer using an open source project you should be supplying
bug fixes (why else should a project be made open source?)

If you are *really* not competent enough to code a bug fix then you
should first search the code for *all* the TODO messages to see if its
a known bug.

You should search for *ALL* TODO messages in the *whole* code base
as sometimes TODO's might be in unexpected places.

As a LAST resort you should goto http://www.chris-camacho.com/contact

"It doesnt work" type "reports" will be ignored as will anything else mentioned
in a source code comment or documents
